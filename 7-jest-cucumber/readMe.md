When you execute `npm test` in your project directory, it triggers the Jest testing framework to run the tests defined in your project.

Here's what happens when you run `npm test`:

1. **npm**:
   - `npm` is the Node.js package manager.
   - When you run `npm test`, npm looks for the `"test"` script in your `package.json` file.

2. **package.json**:
   - In your `package.json` file, you have defined the `"test"` script as `"jest --config=jest.config.js"`.
   - This means that when you run `npm test`, npm will execute Jest with the specified configuration file (`jest.config.js`).

3. **Jest**:
   - Jest is a JavaScript testing framework.
   - Jest reads your `jest.config.js` file to determine the configuration for running tests.
   - In your `jest.config.js` file, you have specified `"**/*.steps.js"` as the `testMatch` pattern, which tells Jest to look for test files ending with `.steps.js`.

4. **Test Execution**:
   - Jest identifies all test files matching the pattern `**/*.steps.js`.
   - For each test file found, Jest executes the tests defined within that file.
   - Jest executes the tests using the `describe` and `test` functions provided by Jest.
   - Within each test file, Jest-Cucumber loads the feature files specified in the test files and matches them with the corresponding step definitions.
   - Jest-Cucumber executes the step definitions corresponding to the steps defined in the feature files.

5. **Test Results**:
   - Jest collects and reports the results of the test execution.
   - It displays information about the number of tests passed, failed, or skipped, along with any error messages or stack traces for failing tests.

Overall, when you run `npm test`, Jest executes the tests defined in your project according to the configuration specified in your `jest.config.js` file and reports the results of the test execution.
